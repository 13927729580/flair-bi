# Welcome to the **Flair BI** wiki!

## Introduction
Flair BI is an opensource, cloud-native and scalable application which is build to provide business and operational intelligence insights. Flair reduces data movement, removes the need to keep data sets in sync, leverages the power of the underlying datasources and Flair's built in caching engine to address the need for quick insights on constantly changing data sources.
